[backend] folder contains the API server and basic database configuration
[frontend] folder contains the React app starter

Both must be started so they "talk" to each other

1. To start and configure the backend server and the "basic" database 
  - cd ./backend and follow the [readme.md] there
  - after all is done [npm run dev] will start the backend server

2. To start the frontend React app:
  - cd ./frontend and follow the [readme.md] there
  - after all is done [npm run dev] will start the React frontend
